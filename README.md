# 🧠 Claude Code Chief of Staff

An Obsidian vault template that turns Claude Code into your personal chief of staff — managing your whole life, not just your work. 🌊

## ✨ What This Is

A ready-to-use vault structure for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) + [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that gives you:

- 💬 **A thinking partner**, not a task bot — Claude reads your vault and helps you plan, decide, and stay focused
- 🌊 **Whole-life management** — work, personal, side projects, health, finances, content — all in one system
- 📅 **Weekly rhythms** — Sunday planning, daily time-blocking, end-of-session persistence
- 🧰 **Modular coaching** — install "toolkit" frameworks (habit building, life design, personality-based coaching) and Claude applies them contextually
- 🔒 **Local-first and secure** — everything is markdown files on your computer. No cloud sync required. No data leaves your machine.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
You talk to Claude throughout your day
        ↓
Claude reads your vault for context
        ↓
Claude helps you plan, decide, route tasks, and stay honest
        ↓
Everything persists in markdown files you own
```

**The stack:**
- 📖 **Obsidian** — where you *read* your vault (any device, beautifully formatted)
- 💻 **VS Code + Claude Code** — where you *work with* your vault (Claude reads files, plans, coaches)
- 📁 **Your vault** — a folder of markdown files. That's it. No database, no proprietary format.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. 📥 **Get the vault** — click the green "Code" button above → "Download ZIP" → unzip → move the folder somewhere permanent
2. 📖 **Open in Obsidian** — Open Obsidian → "Open folder as vault" → select the folder
3. 💻 **Open in VS Code** — File → Open Folder → select the **same folder** → install the Claude Code extension
4. ⭐ **Follow the setup guide** — open `0. Operating System/⭐ Getting Started.md` for install steps, then say **"Let's set up my vault"** to Claude and it walks you through the rest 🤝

## 🔄 Daily Rhythms

| Command | When | What It Does |
|---------|------|-------------|
| ☀️ **"Good Morning"** | Start of day | Reviews calendar, checks tasks, time-blocks your day |
| 📅 **"Plan My Week"** | Sunday | Carries forward unfinished tasks, scans backlogs, drafts the week |
| 📊 **"Debrief"** | Start of session | Catches you up across your whole life |
| 👋 **"TTFN"** | End of session | Saves all context to persistent files before the window closes |

## 📡 Integrations

The vault is the integration layer. External data flows in through bridges — Claude never talks to APIs directly.

| Tier | Risk | Examples |
|------|------|---------|
| 🟢 **1** | Zero | Copy/paste (email, Slack), Apple Shortcuts |
| 🟡 **2** | Low | Obsidian plugins with no API keys (Granola) |
| 🟠 **3** | Medium | Obsidian plugins with API keys (Linear, Google Calendar) |
| 🔴 **4** | Highest | MCP servers (Claude holds credentials) |

Start at Tier 1. Upgrade only when friction justifies it. 🔒

## 💡 Philosophy

- 🎯 **Productivity is not busyness.** More tools ≠ more impact. Being intentional with limited time is the whole game.
- 🌊 **Hold the whole life.** Career, family, health, creativity, finances — one system, one conversation.
- 🔒 **Local-first.** Your data is markdown files on your computer. Swap Claude for any AI that can read a directory. No vendor lock-in.
- 🧭 **Amplify judgment, never replace it.** Claude helps you think. You make every decision.
