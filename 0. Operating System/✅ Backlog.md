# ✅ Backlog

> [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]] | [[🎯 Quarterly Plan]]

*This file is your centralized to-do list. Claude creates sections here during the [[⭐ Getting Started#Step 3 Discover Your Life Domains|discovery conversation]] — one section per life domain, matching the folders it builds for you.* 📋

*Each section links back to its domain hub doc and uses the table format below. Tasks live here, not in domain folders — this keeps your backlog scannable in one place.* 🧹

<!-- Claude will add domain sections here after the discovery conversation. Format:

## 📂 Domain Name
> [[Domain Hub Doc]]

| Done | Task | Due | Status | Notes |
|------|------|-----|--------|-------|
| | | | | |

## ✅ Completed

| Task | Area | Date Completed |
