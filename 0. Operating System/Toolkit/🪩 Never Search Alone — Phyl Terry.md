# 🪩 Never Search Alone — Phyl Terry

> *"The best career decisions are made in community, not isolation. You need a team around you — especially when you think you don't."* 💡

## 🎯 What This Tool Teaches

Career transitions, job searches, and professional reinventions don't have to be lonely. The core practice is forming a **Job Search Council** — a small, structured peer group that meets weekly to support each other's career moves. It's not networking (transactional) — it's mutual accountability and radical generosity among people in similar transitions. The methodology works for active job searches, career pivots, and ongoing professional development. 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾

From *Never Search Alone: The Job Seeker's Playbook*.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### Concept 1: 👥 The Job Search Council

- **What it is:** A small group (3-6 people) who meet weekly for structured career support. Not a networking group. Not a mastermind. Not therapy. It's a **practice** — structured meetings with specific roles, time limits, and accountability. Members don't need to be in the same industry. What they share is the transition itself.
  - 📋 **Structure:** Weekly meetings, 60-90 minutes. Each person gets equal airtime. Rotating facilitator. Specific agenda format (below).
  - 🎯 **Purpose:** Accountability, feedback, emotional support, expanding networks, and breaking isolation
  - 🚫 **Not:** Complaining sessions, advice-giving lectures, or "who do you know" networking
- **When to use it:** During active job searches. During career pivots. When considering a major professional change. Even when employed — as an ongoing professional development practice. 🔄
- **Example:** Three people — a product leader exploring CPO roles, a consultant deciding whether to go in-house, and a founder pivoting to an executive role — meet weekly. Different industries, same transition energy. They hold each other accountable, workshop positioning, and share networks. 🤝

### Concept 2: 📋 The Weekly Meeting Format

- **What it is:** A structured agenda that keeps meetings productive and equitable:
  1. **⚡ Check-in** (5 min each) — "What happened this week? What am I feeling?" Brief, honest, no advice yet.
  2. **🎯 Hot seat** (15-20 min per person, rotating) — One person presents a specific challenge or decision. Group asks clarifying questions, offers perspectives. The hot seat person decides what to act on.
  3. **📝 Commitments** (5 min each) — "What will I do before next week's meeting?" Specific, measurable, time-bound.
  4. **🔗 Generosity round** (5 min) — "Who can I introduce you to? What resource can I share?" Proactive giving, not asking.
- **When to use it:** Every weekly council meeting, without exception. The structure IS the practice — removing it turns the group into an unstructured chat. 📅
- **Example:** During the hot seat, someone says "I have two offers and I'm paralyzed." The group doesn't say "take the one with more money." They ask: "What does your ideal Tuesday look like? Which role gets you closer? What are you afraid of?" 💭

### Concept 3: 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾 Radical Generosity

- **What it is:** The engine of the council. Give before you ask. Share connections, knowledge, and support proactively — not as a transaction ("I'll introduce you if you introduce me") but as a practice ("Who in my network would benefit from meeting this person?"). Generosity compounds: the more you give, the more the network gives back.
  - ✅ **Generosity looks like:** "I know someone who just made that exact transition — want an intro?" / "I saw this article and thought of your situation" / "Let me review your positioning statement"
  - ❌ **Transactional looks like:** "I'll help you if you help me" / "What can you do for me?" / keeping score
- **When to use it:** Every interaction. Not just in council meetings — as a career and life philosophy. When you meet someone, ask: "How can I help this person?" before "How can this person help me?" 💛
- **Example:** A council member isn't actively searching but has a huge network. They spend their hot seat time saying "I've been thinking about who each of you should meet. Here are three intros I want to make." That's radical generosity. ✨

### Concept 4: 🗣️ Positioning and Narrative

- **What it is:** Most people describe themselves by their last job title, not their value proposition. Terry's framework helps you build a clear, compelling positioning statement that answers: "What do you do?" in a way that's memorable and opens doors.
  - 📐 **Formula:** "I help [who] do [what] by [how], which results in [impact]."
  - 🔄 **Workshop it:** Bring your draft to the council. Get feedback. Iterate. It should feel authentic but polished.
  - 🧪 **Test it:** Use it in real conversations. Notice what lands and what gets blank stares. Adjust.
- **When to use it:** When updating LinkedIn, preparing for interviews, networking, or explaining your career pivot. When your current self-description is a job title instead of a value statement. 🎤
- **Example:** Instead of "I'm a product manager at a SaaS company" → "I help growth-stage teams build products that actually get adopted by turning customer insight into roadmap clarity — my last product went from 5K to 50K users in 8 months." 🚀

## 🪞 Reflection Prompts

*Answer these when you first install this tool. Revisit during quarterly review.* 🔄

1. Who are 3-5 people in your life who are also in some kind of career transition? Could they form a council? 👥
2. What's your current positioning statement? Does it describe your title or your value? What would a stranger remember from it? 🗣️
3. When was the last time you proactively helped someone in their career without being asked? What did it feel like? 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾
4. Where in your career are you searching alone right now? What would change if you had a weekly accountability group? 🔍
5. What career question are you sitting with that would benefit from multiple perspectives, not just your own internal debate? 💭

## 🤖 Claude Integration

**When to surface this tool:**
- 💼 When the user is in a career transition, job search, or considering a major professional change
- 🤔 When the user is making a career decision in isolation ("Should I take this offer?")
- 🗣️ When the user needs to articulate their value proposition (LinkedIn, interviews, networking)
- 🤝 When the user mentions networking — reframe from transactional to generosity-first
- 😔 When job search or career change feels lonely or overwhelming

**What Claude should do:**
- When career decisions come up in isolation: "Who else is thinking about this with you? This is a council conversation." 👥
- When the user describes themselves by title: "That's your role. What's your positioning statement?" 🗣️
- When networking feels transactional: "Who can you help this week without being asked?" 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾
- During weekly planning with a council commitment: track it like any other priority ✅
- When the user is stuck on a career question: "What would your council say?" 💭

**Practice triggers:**

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 💼 Career transition discussion | "Do you have a council? If not, who could you form one with?" |
| 🗣️ "How do I describe what I do?" | Workshop positioning using the formula |
| 😔 Job search isolation | "You're searching alone. Who are your 3-5 people?" |
| 🤝 Networking planning | "Lead with generosity — who can you help this week?" |
| 📅 Weekly planning (if council active) | "What's your council commitment this week?" |
| 🤔 Career decision in isolation | "This is a council-grade decision — bring it to the group." |
