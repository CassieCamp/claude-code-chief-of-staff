# ✨ To Be Magnetic — Lacy Phillips

> *"You can't manifest what you want if you don't know who you authentically are."* 💡

## 🎯 What This Tool Teaches

Manifestation isn't wishful thinking — it's identity work. You can only attract what you believe you're worthy of. The four-step process starts with excavating your authentic self (not who you've been conditioned to be), then building a vision from that truth, surrounding yourself with evidence that it's possible, and taking actions that are aligned with — not forcing — the outcome. 🌟

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### Concept 1: 🔑 Authentic Code

- **What it is:** Your authentic code is who you are underneath conditioning — family patterns, societal expectations, past relationships, and limiting beliefs. It's your actual values, desires, and wiring, not what you've been told to want. Discovering it requires honest excavation: what lights you up when no one's watching? What did you love before you learned to perform?
- **When to use it:** When filling in [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]] — especially "The Life I'm Building" and "How I want to feel." When something looks right on paper but feels wrong in your body. When you're chasing someone else's definition of success. 🪞
- **Example:** You keep pursuing VP titles because your family equates success with corporate prestige — but your authentic code craves creative autonomy and teaching. The misalignment creates chronic dissatisfaction no promotion can fix. ⚠️

### Concept 2: 🎨 Vision from Authentic Code

- **What it is:** Build your vision from who you actually are, not from what looks impressive or what others expect. The vision should feel like relief and expansion — not anxiety and striving. If your vision makes you feel heavy, it's not yours.
- **When to use it:** When writing the Life Vision narrative in WLS. When setting annual objectives. When a goal sounds exciting but your body contracts.
- **Example:** Instead of "I want to be a VC-backed founder" (prestige) → "I want to build something that helps people transform, on my own timeline, with creative control" (authentic code). The outcome might look similar — the energy behind it is completely different. 💛

### Concept 3: 🌱 Expanders

- **What it is:** Surround yourself with people who are living proof that what you desire is possible — especially people who share your background or limitations. These are "expanders" — they expand your subconscious belief about what's available to you. If you've never seen someone like you achieve what you want, your nervous system doesn't believe it's possible.
- **When to use it:** When you feel stuck or like your goals are unrealistic. When imposter syndrome hits. During network planning — seek out expanders intentionally, not just "useful contacts." 🤝
- **Example:** You want to be a product leader who also writes and teaches. Finding someone who does all three — especially someone from a non-traditional path — rewires your belief that it's possible. ✨

### Concept 4: 🧭 Aligned Action

- **What it is:** Take action that comes from alignment, not force. Aligned action feels like a pull, not a push. It's responsive — you do the work, then allow space for things to come to you. Forcing outcomes from scarcity ("I need this to work or else") repels. Acting from worthiness ("I'm building toward what I deserve") attracts.
- **When to use it:** When deciding which opportunities to pursue. When you notice yourself gripping or forcing an outcome. When choosing between hustling harder vs. pausing to let something develop. 🌊
- **Example:** Sending a thoughtful follow-up email because you genuinely want the connection = aligned. Sending 50 cold emails from panic because you need revenue this month = forcing. Both involve action — the energy is different. 💡

## 🔗 Connection to the System

| TBM Concept | Where It Shows Up |
|-------------|------------------|
| 🔑 Authentic Code | [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]] — "The Life I'm Building" should come from your code, not conditioning |
| 🎨 Vision from Code | [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]] — time horizons + annual objectives |
| 🌱 Expanders | Network building, community, professional relationships |
| 🧭 Aligned Action | [[🎯 Quarterly Plan]] — YES items should feel like aligned pulls, not anxious pushes |

## 🪞 Reflection Prompts

1. What am I currently pursuing that's based on conditioning (family expectations, societal "shoulds") rather than authentic desire? 🤔
2. Who in my life is an expander — someone living proof that what I want is possible? Am I spending enough time around them? 🌱
3. Where am I forcing vs. flowing right now? What would I stop doing if I trusted the process? 🌊
4. When I imagine my ideal life, does it feel like relief or pressure? If pressure, whose vision am I carrying? 💭
5. What did I love doing before I learned to optimize for success? Is any of that still in my life? 🎨

## 🤖 Claude Integration

**When to surface this tool:**
- 🔭 When the user is filling in Whole Life Strategy and their answers feel performative or "should"-driven
- 😤 When they're forcing an outcome or gripping on a specific result
- 😰 When imposter syndrome shows up
- 🤝 When network/outreach planning happens — prompt for expander-seeking, not just transactional networking

**What Claude should do:**
- Ask "Is this your authentic desire, or conditioning?" when goals feel heavy 🪞
- Ask "Who's an expander for this?" when the user doubts something is possible 🌱
- Flag forcing energy: "Are you pulling toward this, or pushing from scarcity?" ✨
- During WLS or Quarterly Plan review, check: "Do these still feel like yours?" 💛

**Practice triggers:**

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 🔭 Writing WLS vision | "Does this feel like relief or pressure?" |
| 🎯 Setting quarterly priorities | "Is each YES an aligned pull or an anxious push?" |
| 😰 Imposter syndrome moment | "Who's an expander for this? Who's proof it's possible?" |
| 😤 Overcommitting or hustling | "Where are you forcing? What would you drop if you trusted?" |
| 🤝 Network planning | "Seek expanders, not just contacts" |

## 📊 How I'll Know It's Working

- ✅ WLS vision feels like relief when I read it, not pressure 💛
- ✅ I can name 3+ active expanders in my life 🌱
- ✅ I catch myself distinguishing "authentic desire" from "conditioned should" in real time 🪞
- ✅ Quarterly Plan YES items feel like pulls, not obligations 🧭
- ✅ Less gripping on specific outcomes — more trust in the process 🌊
