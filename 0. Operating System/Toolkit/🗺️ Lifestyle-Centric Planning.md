# 🗺️ Lifestyle-Centric Planning — Cal Newport

> *"You don't need to know your One True Passion. You need a promising path that can be shaped over time as you accumulate leverage."* 💡

## 🎯 What This Tool Teaches

Design the life first. Build the career capital to fund it. Shape work to fit the life — not the other way around. Most people pick a career and then try to squeeze a life around it. Newport inverts this: define the lifestyle you want, then work backward to career configurations that can support it. The career is the vehicle, not the destination. 🚀

From *So Good They Can't Ignore You* and *Deep Work*.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### Concept 1: 🏡 Lifestyle-First Design (The 5 Steps)

- **What it is:** A sequence for building a life you don't need a vacation from:
  1. **Define your ideal lifestyle** — not "what job do I want?" but "what does a typical week look like when everything's working?" Include hours, location, income, non-negotiables, and how you want to *feel*.
  2. **Work backward to career paths** — generate 3-5 configurations that could fund the lifestyle. Don't filter by resume — filter by structural fit (hours, autonomy, income, location).
  3. **Reality-check each path** — income band, time to reach, skill bar, lifestyle tradeoffs. Cross off anything that violates your non-negotiables.
  4. **Choose a "good enough" path** — not your One True Passion, but a promising experiment. You'll shape it as you accumulate leverage.
  5. **Iterate with small experiments** — test your chosen path in 6-month increments. Gather evidence. Adjust. Repeat. 🔄
- **When to use it:** When filling in [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]]. When considering a career change. During annual review.
- **Example:** Instead of "Should I take this VP role?" → "Does this VP role support 2x90-min deep work blocks, school pickup at 3pm, and $X income? Does it build career capital I can trade for more control later?" 🤔

### Concept 2: 💎 Career Capital and the Craftsman Mindset

- **What it is:** Career capital = rare and valuable skills you can trade for lifestyle control. The craftsman mindset asks "What can I build that's rare and valuable?" instead of the passion mindset's "What does this job give me?"
  - ❌ **Passion mindset** (replace this): "Is this my passion? Does it fulfill me right now?"
  - ✅ **Craftsman mindset** (adopt this): "What skills and results can I build that are rare and valuable in my chosen path?"
- **When to use it:** When choosing what skills to develop (Craft Plan in WLS). When feeling dissatisfied with work — check if you're in passion mindset or craftsman mindset.
- **Example:** Instead of "I don't feel passionate about this project" → "What rare skill am I building by doing this project well? How does it increase my leverage for the lifestyle I want?" 🔧

### Concept 3: ⚖️ The Five Cs (Life Satisfaction Buckets)

- **What it is:** Newport's framework for a complete life. Rank these to understand your values:
  - 🤝 **Community** — deep relationships, belonging, being part of something
  - 🔧 **Craft** — mastery, building skill, getting better at something that matters
  - 💪 **Constitution** — physical health, energy, body, movement
  - 🧘 **Contemplation** — reflection, learning, inner life, meaning-making
  - 🎉 **Celebration** — joy, fun, play, savoring life's pleasures
- **When to use it:** When defining Life Vision values in WLS. When something feels off — which C is starved? (See also [[🌊 The Deep Life]] tool for the operational practice of balancing all five.)
- **Example:** If you rank Community #1 but your career path requires 60-hour solo weeks with no team interaction, there's a structural mismatch. ⚠️

### Concept 4: 🏗️ Structural Constraints (Making the Vision Concrete)

- **What it is:** Three variables that turn an abstract vision into a testable plan:
  - 💰 **Income** — not aspirational max, but the floor where money stress disappears + the comfort number
  - 📍 **Location** — city/town, climate, proximity to family, commute tolerance
  - 💼 **Work type** — remote/hybrid/office, solo/team, project-based/stable, sprint/sustainable, travel tolerance
- **When to use it:** When filling in Life Vision (Section 1 of WLS). When evaluating any new opportunity — does it fit the structural constraints?
- **Example:** "I need $200K+ to eliminate money stress, want to stay in my city, need hybrid with max 2 days in-office, and won't miss school pickup." Any opportunity that violates these gets a NO. 🚫

## 🪞 Reflection Prompts

*Use these when filling in [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]] for the first time. Revisit during annual review.* 🔄

1. If you had to describe your ideal Tuesday in detail — not Monday (reactive), not Friday (winding down) — what would it look like from wake to sleep?
2. What are you currently tolerating in your life that you'd eliminate if you could? What's the structural reason it persists?
3. What would you do differently if you knew your current career path was a 5-year experiment, not a permanent commitment?
4. Who are 2-3 people whose lives look like what you want? What career configuration enabled their lifestyle? What career capital did they need?
5. What non-negotiable have you been quietly negotiating away? Name it. 🎯

## 🔄 Review Cadences

*These prompts live here (the framework) so WLS stays clean. Reference these during reviews.*

### 📅 Monthly Pulse Check (~15-30 min)
*First Sunday of each month. Catch drift before it compounds.*

**Pattern recognition (look at the last 4 weekly plans):**
- How many days did I shut down on time?
- What percentage of my weeks were spent on signal vs. noise?
- Which annual objective got the most attention? Which got neglected?
- Did any Toolkit tools actually show up in my daily work, or did I forget about them?

**Course correction:**
- ➕ What's one thing I should do MORE of next month?
- 🛑 What's one thing I should STOP or delegate?
- 🚧 Is anything from my quarterly plan stalled? What's blocking it?
- 💛 Am I taking care of my body and my family, or sacrificing them for output?

### 🎯 Quarterly Review (~60-90 min)
*Start of each quarter. Strategic reset — answer before updating [[🎯 Quarterly Plan]].*

**Life alignment:**
- Did my daily life this quarter look more like my Life Vision, or less?
- What were my best weeks? What made them good? ✨
- What were my worst weeks? What went wrong? 🚧

**Career configuration:**
- Which parts of my career configuration worked? Which created friction?
- Am I accumulating career capital — more leverage now than 3 months ago? 💎
- Did I actually practice my craft plan skills, or did they stay theoretical?

**Strategic adjustment:**
- Are my annual objectives still the right ones? 🧭
- What low-risk experiment should I run next quarter?
- What tools should I install, uninstall, or update in my Toolkit?
- What would I change about my life vision based on what I've learned?

**Action:** Update [[🎯 Quarterly Plan]] with new YES/NO priorities.

### 🔭 Annual Review (~half day)
*Once a year (December or January). Full redesign — revisit [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]] from the top.*

- 🌟 **Life Vision:** Does it still feel true? Has anything changed (relationship, career, health, family)?
- 💼 **Career Configuration:** Still the right experiment? Need new candidate paths? Income floor changed?
- 🔧 **Craft Plan:** Which skills served you? Which new ones are emerging? Toolkit still right?
- 🏆 **Annual Objectives:** Score last year (done / partial / abandoned / irrelevant). Set new ones.
- 🪞 **Self-Knowledge:** What did you learn about how you operate?
- 🧪 **Experiments:** Close completed ones. What's the big experiment for next year?

## 🤖 Claude Integration

**When to surface this tool:**
- When the user is filling in or reviewing [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]] 🔭
- During annual review (December/January)
- When evaluating a new career opportunity (does it fit the structural constraints?)
- When the user is in passion mindset ("I don't feel excited about this") — redirect to craftsman mindset 💎

**What Claude should do:**
- During annual review, walk through the review prompts section by section
- When a new opportunity appears, run it through the structural constraints filter
- When the user doubts their path, remind them: "good enough path that can be shaped as you build leverage" 🌱
- During quarterly review, prompt the quarterly review questions before updating Quarterly Plan

**Practice triggers:**

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 📅 First Sunday of month | Prompt monthly pulse check |
| 🎯 Start of quarter | Run quarterly review prompts before Quarterly Plan update |
| 🔭 December/January | Trigger full annual review of WLS |
| 💼 New job opportunity appears | Run structural constraints filter |
| 😔 "I don't feel passionate about this" | Redirect: craftsman mindset — what career capital are you building? |

## 📊 How I'll Know It's Working

- ✅ Annual objectives are set by mid-January each year
- ✅ Quarterly Plan traces explicitly back to annual objectives (not floating priorities)
- ✅ Career opportunities are evaluated against structural constraints, not just comp/title
- ✅ Monthly pulse checks are actually happening (not skipped 3 months in a row)
- ✅ Life Vision narrative gets revisited at least once a year
