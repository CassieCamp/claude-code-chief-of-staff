# 📖 Cal Newport — Lifestyle-Centric Planning + The Deep Life

> *"You don't need to know your One True Passion. You need a promising path that can be shaped over time as you accumulate leverage."* 💡
>
> *"The deep life is about focusing with energetic intention on things that really matter — in work, at home, and in your soul — and not wasting too much attention on things that don't."* 🌊

## 🎯 What This Tool Teaches

Two complementary frameworks from Newport's work:

1. **Lifestyle-Centric Planning** (*So Good They Can't Ignore You*, *Deep Work*) — Design the life first. Build the career capital to fund it. Shape work to fit the life — not the other way around. The career is the vehicle, not the destination. 🚀

2. **The Deep Life** (*Deep Questions podcast*) — Life satisfaction comes from intense focus on what matters across five categories — not from optimizing one area while the others decay. The path to depth is incremental: month by month, amplify what matters and reduce what doesn't. 🌟

## 🧩 Part 1: Lifestyle-Centric Planning

### Concept 1: 🏡 Lifestyle-First Design (The 5 Steps)

- **What it is:** A sequence for building a life you don't need a vacation from:
  1. **Define your ideal lifestyle** — not "what job do I want?" but "what does a typical week look like when everything's working?" Include hours, location, income, non-negotiables, and how you want to *feel*.
  2. **Work backward to career paths** — generate 3-5 configurations that could fund the lifestyle. Don't filter by resume — filter by structural fit (hours, autonomy, income, location).
  3. **Reality-check each path** — income band, time to reach, skill bar, lifestyle tradeoffs. Cross off anything that violates your non-negotiables.
  4. **Choose a "good enough" path** — not your One True Passion, but a promising experiment. You'll shape it as you accumulate leverage.
  5. **Iterate with small experiments** — test your chosen path in 6-month increments. Gather evidence. Adjust. Repeat. 🔄
- **When to use it:** When filling in [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]]. When considering a career change. During annual review.
- **Example:** Instead of "Should I take this VP role?" → "Does this VP role support 2x90-min deep work blocks, school pickup at 3pm, and $X income? Does it build career capital I can trade for more control later?" 🤔

### Concept 2: 💎 Career Capital and the Craftsman Mindset

- **What it is:** Career capital = rare and valuable skills you can trade for lifestyle control. The craftsman mindset asks "What can I build that's rare and valuable?" instead of the passion mindset's "What does this job give me?"
  - ❌ **Passion mindset** (replace this): "Is this my passion? Does it fulfill me right now?"
  - ✅ **Craftsman mindset** (adopt this): "What skills and results can I build that are rare and valuable in my chosen path?"
- **When to use it:** When choosing what skills to develop. When feeling dissatisfied with work — check if you're in passion mindset or craftsman mindset.
- **Example:** Instead of "I don't feel passionate about this project" → "What rare skill am I building by doing this project well? How does it increase my leverage for the lifestyle I want?" 🔧

### Concept 3: 🏗️ Structural Constraints (Making the Vision Concrete)

- **What it is:** Three variables that turn an abstract vision into a testable plan:
  - 💰 **Income** — not aspirational max, but the floor where money stress disappears + the comfort number
  - 📍 **Location** — city/town, climate, proximity to family, commute tolerance
  - 💼 **Work type** — remote/hybrid/office, solo/team, project-based/stable, sprint/sustainable, travel tolerance
- **When to use it:** When filling in Life Vision (Section 1 of WLS). When evaluating any new opportunity — does it fit the structural constraints?
- **Example:** "I need $200K+ to eliminate money stress, want to stay in my city, need hybrid with max 2 days in-office, and won't miss school pickup." Any opportunity that violates these gets a NO. 🚫

## 🧩 Part 2: The Deep Life

### Concept 4: ⚖️ The Five Buckets

- **What it is:** Every area of a meaningful life falls into one of five categories:
  - 🔧 **Craft** — work, quality leisure, skill-building, career capital
  - 🤝 **Community** — family, friends, relationships, belonging
  - 💪 **Constitution** — physical health, energy, movement, body
  - 🧘 **Contemplation** — reflection, learning, inner life, meaning-making, spiritual practice
  - 🎉 **Celebration** — joy, play, fun, savoring life's pleasures, creative expression for its own sake
- **When to use it:** During quarterly and monthly reviews. When something feels off, diagnose *which bucket* is empty — the discomfort often comes from neglecting one while over-indexing on another.
- **Example:** Feeling burned out despite career progress? Check Constitution and Community — Craft can't compensate for an empty body or isolated life. Feeling heavy despite ticking every box? Celebration might be starved — when's the last time you did something purely for fun? 🎨

### Concept 5: 📈 Amplify and Reduce

- **What it is:** For each bucket, identify two things:
  1. ➕ **Amplify** — a high-impact habit that significantly increases the value you get from this area
  2. ➖ **Reduce** — a commitment to cut sources of distraction or unnecessary effort draining this area
- **When to use it:** Monthly. Pick one amplify + one reduce per bucket. Test for 30 days. Keep what works, drop what doesn't. Repeat. 🔄
- **Example:**

| | ➕ Amplify | ➖ Reduce |
|---|---------|--------|
| 🔧 **Craft** | Deep work blocks: 2x 90-min sessions before noon | Meeting scheduling software to protect deep/shallow ratio |
| 🤝 **Community** | Weekly family dinner — phones away, candles lit | Remove Instagram from phone |
| 💪 **Constitution** | 10,000 steps daily + eat clean | Alcohol only on weekends |
| 🧘 **Contemplation** | Morning journaling or prayer (10 min) | Eliminate doomscrolling before bed |
| 🎉 **Celebration** | Dance in the kitchen 5 min daily, monthly friend date | Stop treating fun as "earned" — schedule it first |

### Concept 6: 🌱 Incremental Depth (Not Master Plans)

- **What it is:** Resist the urge to build a master plan that transforms everything at once. Instead, experiment with smaller shifts — roughly one month at a time. The deep life is cultivated through compounding small changes, not dramatic overhauls.
- **When to use it:** When you feel the pull to redesign everything. When a new system or life change tempts you into "this will fix everything" thinking. When overwhelmed — go smaller, not bigger. 🎯
- **Example:** Instead of "I'm going to overhaul my entire morning routine, diet, exercise plan, and work schedule starting Monday" → pick ONE amplify and ONE reduce in the bucket that feels most depleted. Test for 30 days. Then add the next. 🧪

## 🪞 Reflection Prompts

*Use these when filling in [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]] for the first time. Revisit during reviews.* 🔄

### Lifestyle-Centric Planning
1. If you had to describe your ideal Tuesday in detail — not Monday (reactive), not Friday (winding down) — what would it look like from wake to sleep?
2. What are you currently tolerating in your life that you'd eliminate if you could? What's the structural reason it persists?
3. What would you do differently if you knew your current career path was a 5-year experiment, not a permanent commitment?
4. Who are 2-3 people whose lives look like what you want? What career configuration enabled their lifestyle? What career capital did they need?
5. What non-negotiable have you been quietly negotiating away? Name it. 🎯

### The Deep Life
6. For each bucket (Craft, Community, Constitution, Contemplation, Celebration) — where am I right now on a 1-10 scale? Which one, if I raised it 2 points, would change my life the most?
7. What am I spending attention on that doesn't fall into any of the five buckets? That's the detritus to clear. 🧹
8. Where am I being "comfortably numb" — going through the motions without energetic intention?
9. What would look radical to outsiders but would bring me deep satisfaction? 🌟
10. Which bucket am I over-indexing on at the expense of the others?

| 🤝 Community | "The Life I'm Building" — relationships, family, belonging |
| 💪 Constitution | Structural Constraints + "How I want to feel" |
| 🧘 Contemplation | "How I want to feel" — inner life, meaning-making |
| 🎉 Celebration | "How I want to feel" — joy, play, lightness |

## 🔄 Review Cadences

*These prompts live here (the framework) so WLS stays clean. Reference these during reviews.*

### 📅 Monthly Pulse Check (~15-30 min)
*First Sunday of each month. Catch drift before it compounds.*

**Pattern recognition (look at the last 4 weekly plans):**
- How many days did I shut down on time?
- What percentage of my weeks were spent on signal vs. noise?
- Which annual objective got the most attention? Which got neglected?
- Did any Toolkit tools actually show up in my daily work, or did I forget about them?

**Deep Life check:**
- Score each bucket 1-10. Compare to last month.
- Update Amplify/Reduce table.

**Course correction:**
- ➕ What's one thing I should do MORE of next month?
- 🛑 What's one thing I should STOP or delegate?
- 🚧 Is anything from my quarterly plan stalled? What's blocking it?
- 💛 Am I taking care of my body and my family, or sacrificing them for output?

### 🎯 Quarterly Review (~60-90 min)
*Start of each quarter. Strategic reset — answer before updating [[🎯 Quarterly Plan]].*

**Life alignment:**
- Did my daily life this quarter look more like my Life Vision, or less?
- What were my best weeks? What made them good? ✨
- What were my worst weeks? What went wrong? 🚧

**Career configuration:**
- Which parts of my career configuration worked? Which created friction?
- Am I accumulating career capital — more leverage now than 3 months ago? 💎
- Did I actually practice my craft plan skills, or did they stay theoretical?

**Deep Life buckets:**
- Score all five buckets 1-10. Compare to last quarter.
- Which bucket grew? Which decayed?

**Strategic adjustment:**
- Are my annual objectives still the right ones? 🧭
- What low-risk experiment should I run next quarter?
- What tools should I install, uninstall, or update in my Toolkit?
- What would I change about my life vision based on what I've learned?

**Action:** Update [[🎯 Quarterly Plan]] with new YES/NO priorities.

### 🔭 Annual Review (~half day)
*Once a year (December or January). Full redesign — revisit [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]] from the top.*

- 🌟 **Life Vision:** Does it still feel true? Has anything changed (relationship, career, health, family)?
- 💼 **Career Configuration:** Still the right experiment? Need new candidate paths? Income floor changed?
- 🔧 **Craft Plan:** Which skills served you? Which new ones are emerging? Toolkit still right?
- 🏆 **Annual Objectives:** Score last year (done / partial / abandoned / irrelevant). Set new ones.
- ⚖️ **Five Buckets:** Year-in-review scoring. Which bucket got the most love? Which was neglected?
- 🪞 **Self-Knowledge:** What did you learn about how you operate?
- 🧪 **Experiments:** Close completed ones. What's the big experiment for next year?

## 🤖 Claude Integration

**When to surface this tool:**
- 🔭 When the user is filling in or reviewing [[🔭 Whole Life Strategy]]
- 📅 During monthly pulse checks (first Sunday of each month)
- 🎯 During quarterly or annual review
- 💼 When evaluating a new career opportunity (run it through structural constraints)
- 😔 When the user is in passion mindset ("I don't feel excited about this") — redirect to craftsman mindset 💎
- 😓 When the user says they feel "off" or burned out but can't pinpoint why
- ⚠️ When one area of life is consuming all attention (e.g., all Craft, no Constitution)

**What Claude should do:**
- During annual review, walk through the review prompts section by section
- When a new opportunity appears, run it through the structural constraints filter
- When the user doubts their path, remind them: "good enough path that can be shaped as you build leverage" 🌱
- Ask "Which bucket is empty right now?" when user seems drained 🪣
- During monthly review, prompt the Amplify/Reduce table update
- Flag when weekly plans are 100% Craft with zero Community/Constitution/Contemplation/Celebration 🚩
- When user proposes a big life overhaul: "What's the smallest 30-day experiment you could run instead?" 🧪
- When everything feels heavy despite productivity: "When's the last time you did something purely for Celebration?" 🎉

**Practice triggers:**

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 📅 First Sunday of month | Prompt monthly pulse check + Amplify/Reduce refresh |
| 🎯 Start of quarter | Run quarterly review prompts before Quarterly Plan update |
| 🔭 December/January | Trigger full annual review of WLS |
| 💼 New job opportunity appears | Run structural constraints filter |
| 😔 "I don't feel passionate about this" | Redirect: craftsman mindset — what career capital are you building? |
| 😓 User feels burned out | "Which bucket is empty?" diagnostic |
| ⚠️ Weekly plan is all work | Flag: "Where's Constitution, Community, and Celebration this week?" |
| 🔄 User proposes dramatic change | Redirect to 30-day experiment framing |
| 😐 Everything productive but joyless | "Celebration bucket check — when did you last play?" |

## 📊 How I'll Know It's Working

- ✅ Annual objectives are set by mid-January each year
- ✅ Quarterly Plan traces explicitly back to annual objectives (not floating priorities)
- ✅ Career opportunities are evaluated against structural constraints, not just comp/title
- ✅ Monthly pulse checks are actually happening (not skipped 3 months in a row)
- ✅ Life Vision narrative gets revisited at least once a year
- ✅ No bucket stays below 5/10 for two consecutive months
- ✅ Weekly plans consistently include at least one non-Craft item
- ✅ Celebration is treated as essential, not earned — it shows up in the plan, not just as a reward 🎉
